MySQL

1. MySQL is the most popular open source relational SQL database management system.

2. MySQL is one of the best RDBMS being used for developing web-based software application.

What is data?
	Data can be facts related to any object in consideration.
	
	For example, your name, age, hight etc are some data related to you.
	
	An image, file, pdf etc can also be data.
	
What is database?
	A database is systematic collection of data.
	
	They support electronic storage and manipulation of data.
	
	Databases make data management easy.
	
Database Components
	1. Hardware
	2. Software
	3. Data
	4. Procedure
	5. Data Access Language

What is DBMS (Database Management System)?

	DBMS is a collection of programs that enable its users to access databases, manipulate data, report data.
	
	It also helps to control access to the database.
	
	Database management systems are not a new concept, it is first implemented in 1960's.
	
	Charles Bachman's Integrated Data Store(IDS) is the first DBMS in history.
	
How to create a database?
create database MoviesDatabase;


use MoviesDatabase;


What is table?
	1. Tables are database objects that contain all the data.
	
	2. In tables, data is logically organized in a row and column format similar to spread sheet.
	
	3. Each row represents a unique record.
	
	4. Each column represents a field in a record.
	
Creating a table.
	By using "create" command.
	
What is InnoDB?
	1. InnoDB is a general purpose storage engine that balances high reliability and high performance.
	
	2. From mysql 5.6, InnoDB is the default storage engine.
	
	3. Proir to InnoDB, MyISAM is the default storate engine.
	
SQL 

1. Structured Query Language(SQL) as we all know is the database language by the use of which we can perform certain operations on the existing database and also we can create a new database.

2. These SQL commands are mainly categorized into 4 types
	1. DDL ==> Data Definition Language
	2. DQL ==> Data Query Language
	3. DML ==> Data Manupulation Language
	4. DCL (TCL) ==> Data Control Language (Transaction Control Language)
	
DDL
1. DDL actually consists those commands by which we can define the database schema.

2. DDL is a set of SQL commands used to create, modify, and delete database structures but not data.

List of DDL Commands
1. CREATE
2. DROP
3. ALTER
3. TRUNCATE
4. RENAME

ALTER
	The MySQL alter command is used when you want to change name of your table, any fields(columns) or if you want to add or delete a column in the table.
	
TRUNCATE
	This command is used to remove all records from a table.
DML
The SQL commands that deals with manipulation of data present in the database.

List of DML Commands
1. INSERT
2. UPDATE
3. DELETE

INSERT
	The insert statement allows you to insert one or more number of rows into a table.
	
auto_increment
	for this type of column we never give the value while inserting.

UPDATE
The update command updates data in a table.


DELETE
	To delete data from a table.
	
	delete from <table-name>
	where <condition>;
	
	
14:45:13	delete from employees where employeeNumber = 1323	Error Code: 1451. Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails (`classicmodels`.`customers`, CONSTRAINT `customers_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`salesRepEmployeeNumber`) REFERENCES `employees` (`employeenumber`))	0.141 sec

14:49:18	delete from customers  where customernumber=103	Error Code: 1451. Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails (`classicmodels`.`orders`, CONSTRAINT `orders_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`customerNumber`) REFERENCES `customers` (`customernumber`))	1.594 sec


Constraints in mysql
	Constraint?
	a limitation or restriction.
	
Constraints in MySQL
	1. null
	2. not null
	3. primary key
	4. foreign key
	

15:24:18	insert customers(address) values('Mumbai')	Error Code: 1364. Field 'name' doesn't have a default value	0.031 sec

15:26:49	insert customers values (1, 'Chaithu', 'Bangalore')	Error Code: 1062. Duplicate entry '1' for key 'PRIMARY'	0.125 sec

an empty value is never equivalent to a null value.

primary key never takes a duplicate value.

foreign key constraint
	a key will depending another key of another table.
	
	In this case one table will be related with another table.
	
	They are called in parent-child relation.
	
	One is parent table (master).

	Other one is child table (details).
	
	departments
	employees
	
Select Command
	
1. Select statement allows us to select data from one or more tables.

sort

select
	select-list
from <Table-Name>
Order By
	<column1> [ASC]/DESC,
	<column2> [ASC]/DESC,.....;

sort data using a custom list

we must use field() method

where clause
	The where clause allows us to specify search condition for the rows returned by the query.
	
select
	select-list
from table-name
where search-condtion;

Here search condition is a combination of one or more expressions using logical operators AND, OR, NOT.


When executing a select statement with a where clause, MySQL evaluates the where clause after the from clause.

FROM -> WHERE -> SELECT -> ORDER BY

IS NULL Operator

1. To check if a value is null or not null, you have to use isnull operator , not the equal operator.

where jobtitle = null == wrong

where jobtitle is null ==> right

2. The isnull operator returns True if a value is null.

3. In the database terms, null is a marker that indicates that a value is missing or unknown.

4.  null is not equivivalent to a number 0

DISTINCT clause

1. When querying data from a table, you may get duplicate rows.

2. To remove duplicate rows, you use the distinct clause in the select statement.
3. If you specify one column, the distinct clause evaluates the uniqueness of rows based on the values of that column.

FROM -> WHERE -> SELECT -> DISTINCT -> ORDER BY


LIKE
	1. The like operator is logical operator that tests whether a string contains a specified pattern or not.
	
	2. The like operator is having two wildcards(%, _).
	
	3. % means any character and any no of characters.
	
	4. _ means any character and for one _ only one character.

14:59:06	_	Error Code: 1064. You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near '_' at line 1	0.000 sec


joins

1. A relational database consists of multiple related tables linking together using common columns, which are known as foreign key columns.

2. join is a method of linking data between one or more tables based on values of the common column between the tables.

3. MySQL supports the following types of joins

1. Inner Join
2. Left (Outer) Join
3. Right (Outer) Join
4. Cross Join
 
Inner Join

The inner join matches each row in one table with every rown in another table and allows you to query row that contain columns from both the tables.


Left join


select concat(emp.first_name,' ',emp.last_name) employee,
        emp.salary emp_sal,
        concat(mgr.first_name,' ',mgr.last_name) manager,
        mgr.salary mgr_sal
 from employees emp
 join employees mgr on emp.manager_id = mgr.employee_id;




set @input:=3;
 select employee_id, 
        first_name,
        last_name,
        job_id,
        salary 
 from employees e 
 where @input =(select COUNT(DISTINCT Salary) 
           from employees p 
           where e.Salary<=p.Salary);








select concat(first_name,' ',last_name) employee,
 salary,
 case
 when salary >=2000 and salary < 5000 then "low" 
 when salary >=5000 and salary < 10000 then "mid"
 else
 "high"
 end as salary_level
 from employees
 order by 1;
